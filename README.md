# RaceNGuilds

RaceNGuilds is a PaperMC plugin that combines **races and guilds into one system**.  
When a player joins the server, they choose a **race**, and that race becomes their **guild**.

Each race has unique **bonuses and drawbacks**, encouraging different playstyles, PvP strategies, and economic roles.

The plugin also includes **custom items** and **special TXT files** required for full functionality.
